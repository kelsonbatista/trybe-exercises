# UNIX AND BASH

## All about Unix and Bash

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox, replacement for the Bourne shell. Released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributors.

There is a version for Windows, Solaris and MacOS.

Bash is a command processor that tipically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.
